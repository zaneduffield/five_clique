# Five Clique

My attempt at a solution to the problem of finding five English words with 25 distinct characters as discussed on the [A problem squared podcast](https://aproblemsquared.libsyn.com/) by Hill and Parker.

This solution was largely inspired by a previous solution by [Benjamin Paassen](https://gitlab.com/bpaassen/five_clique).
